        #4 up from A1. This would probably be done using a grid/coordinate plane.

        #while calculate_movement changes the coordinates of a peice, this needs to actively move the
        #checkers peice from one coordinate to another. The way I need to do this is probably by having the coords
        #actually move the circle from one place to another. It would duplicate the circle to another slot,
        #then delete the circle from its original location.
